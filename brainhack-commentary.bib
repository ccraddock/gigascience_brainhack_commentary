abstract = "Abstract When defining an \{MRI\} protocol, brain researchers need to set multiple interdependent parameters that define repetition time (TR), voxel size, field-of-view (FOV), etc. Typically, researchers aim to image the full brain, making the expected \{FOV\} an important parameter to consider. Especially in 2D-EPI sequences, non-wasteful \{FOV\} settings are important to achieve the best temporal and spatial resolution. In practice, however, imperfect \{FOV\} size estimation often results in partial brain coverage for a significant number of participants per study, or, alternatively, an unnecessarily large voxel-size or number of slices to guarantee full brain coverage. To provide normative \{FOV\} guidelines we estimated population distributions of brain size in the x-, y-, and z-direction using data from 14,781 individuals. Our results indicated that 11 mm in the z-direction differentiate between obtaining full brain coverage for 90% vs. 99.9% of participants. Importantly, we observed that rotating the \{FOV\} to optimally cover the brain, and thus minimize the number of slices needed, effectively reduces the required inferior–superior \{FOV\} size by ~ 5%. For a typical adult imaging study, 99.9% of the population can be imaged with full brain coverage when using an inferior–superior \{FOV\} of 142 mm, assuming optimal slice orientation and minimal within-scan head motion. By providing population distributions for brain size in the x-, y-, and z-direction we improve the potential for obtaining full brain coverage, especially in 2D-EPI sequences used in most functional and diffusion \{MRI\} studies. We further enable optimization of related imaging parameters including the number of slices, \{TR\} and total acquisition time. "

abstract = "Abstract The examination of functional connectivity in fMRI data collected during task-free “rest” has provided a powerful tool for studying functional brain organization. Limitations of this approach include susceptibility to head motion artifacts and participant drowsiness or sleep. These issues are especially relevant when studying young children or clinical populations. Here we introduce a movie paradigm, Inscapes, that features abstract shapes without a narrative or scene-cuts. The movie was designed to provide enough stimulation to improve compliance related to motion and wakefulness while minimizing cognitive load during the collection of functional imaging data. We compare Inscapes to eyes-open rest and to age-appropriate movie clips in healthy adults (Ocean's Eleven, n = 22) and a pilot sample of typically developing children ages 3–7 (Fantasia, n = 13). Head motion was significantly lower during both movies relative to rest for both groups. In adults, movies decreased the number of participants who self-reported sleep. Intersubject correlations, used to quantify synchronized, task-evoked activity across movie and rest conditions in adults, involved less cortex during Inscapes than Ocean's Eleven. To evaluate the effect of movie-watching on intrinsic functional connectivity networks, we examined mean functional connectivity using both whole-brain functional parcellation and network-based approaches. Both inter- and intra-network metrics were more similar between Inscapes and Rest than between Ocean's Eleven and Rest, particularly in comparisons involving the default network. When comparing movies to Rest, the mean functional connectivity of somatomotor, visual and ventral attention networks differed significantly across various analyses. We conclude that low-demand movies like Inscapes may represent a useful intermediate condition between task-free rest and typical narrative movies while still improving participant compliance. Inscapes is publicly available for download at headspacestudios.org/inscapes. "

abstract="Much like genomics, brain connectomics has rapidly become a core component of most national brain projects around the world. Beyond the ambitious aims of these projects, a fundamental challenge is the need for an efficient, robust, reliable and easy-to-use pipeline to mine such large neuroscience datasets. Here, we introduce a computational pipeline---namely the Connectome Computation System (CCS)---for discovery science of human brain connectomes at the macroscale with multimodal magnetic resonance imaging technologies. The CCS is designed with a three-level hierarchical structure that includes data cleaning and preprocessing, individual connectome mapping and connectome mining, and knowledge discovery. Several functional modules are embedded into this hierarchy to implement quality control procedures, reliability analysis and connectome visualization. We demonstrate the utility of the CCS based upon a publicly available dataset, the NKI--Rockland Sample, to delineate the normative trajectories of well-known large-scale neural networks across the natural life span (6--85 years of age). The CCS has been made freely available to the public via GitHub (                  https://github.com/zuoxinian/CCS                                  ) and our laboratory's Web site (                  http://lfcd.psych.ac.cn/ccs.html                                  ) to facilitate progress in discovery science in the field of human brain connectomics.",
