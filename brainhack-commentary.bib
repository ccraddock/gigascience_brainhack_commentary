abstract = "Abstract When defining an \{MRI\} protocol, brain researchers need to set multiple interdependent parameters that define repetition time (TR), voxel size, field-of-view (FOV), etc. Typically, researchers aim to image the full brain, making the expected \{FOV\} an important parameter to consider. Especially in 2D-EPI sequences, non-wasteful \{FOV\} settings are important to achieve the best temporal and spatial resolution. In practice, however, imperfect \{FOV\} size estimation often results in partial brain coverage for a significant number of participants per study, or, alternatively, an unnecessarily large voxel-size or number of slices to guarantee full brain coverage. To provide normative \{FOV\} guidelines we estimated population distributions of brain size in the x-, y-, and z-direction using data from 14,781 individuals. Our results indicated that 11 mm in the z-direction differentiate between obtaining full brain coverage for 90% vs. 99.9% of participants. Importantly, we observed that rotating the \{FOV\} to optimally cover the brain, and thus minimize the number of slices needed, effectively reduces the required inferior–superior \{FOV\} size by ~ 5%. For a typical adult imaging study, 99.9% of the population can be imaged with full brain coverage when using an inferior–superior \{FOV\} of 142 mm, assuming optimal slice orientation and minimal within-scan head motion. By providing population distributions for brain size in the x-, y-, and z-direction we improve the potential for obtaining full brain coverage, especially in 2D-EPI sequences used in most functional and diffusion \{MRI\} studies. We further enable optimization of related imaging parameters including the number of slices, \{TR\} and total acquisition time. "
