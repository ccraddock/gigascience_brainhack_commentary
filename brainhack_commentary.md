The modern conference can provide a space for interaction across institutional boundaries...

How can a conference uniquely contribute to the sharing of information, the generation of new ideas, the inpsiring moment of curiosity. In the age of the Internet, were ideas can so easily be shared, what unique role does the conference space contribute? Brainhack, in part, was an answer to the challenge of creating a space which disolved traditional academic hierarchies, structured programs, even predetermined content, to open opportunities for something new to emerge--- to sew seeds of collaboration.
