With myriad possibilities for the instantaneous sharing of scientific research available today, how can the contemporary conference format take unique advantage of the personal contact it provides? *Brainhack* has  provide a space for interaction across institutional boundaries...

How can the contemporary conference format contribute in innovative ways to the sharing of information, the generation of new ideas, and the catalyzing of curiosity? In the age of the Internet, where ideas can so easily be shared, what unique role does the conference space provide? Brainhack, in part, was an answer to the challenge of creating a space which dissolved traditional academic hierarchies, structured programs, even predetermined content, to open opportunities for something new to emerge--- to sew seeds of collaboration.



# Introducing Brainhack

- What is brainhack: (explain brainhacks to the uninitiated - this has always been our biggest challenge)
	- legitimize brainhacks to community and potential partners
	- encourage participation (make everyone feel invited and as though they can make a real contribution, or at least get something out of it)
		- but im not a programmer how do can I contribute? 

Now in their third year, international and regional Brainhack events bring together brain enthusiasts from a variety of backgrounds to build relationships, learn from one another, and collaborate on research projects related to the brain. Brainhacks are unconventional events that adapt organizational elements from hackathons and unconferences for the needs of the brain research community. Similar to hackathons, Brainhack events primarily involve unstructured time during which participants collaborate intensively to complete various projects. But rather than focusing on computer programming, projects at Brainhack can be completed using a much broader array of methods. Time is also set aside for periodic "unconference" sessions, which involve presentations whose content is dynamically determined based on the interests of attendees. This combined model encourages active participation and interaction between attendees, maximizing the relevance of the content.

There is no ideal background, skill set or experience level for Brainhack attendees. Fully translating neuroscience data to knowledge requires expertise that spans from biology, computer science, engineering, mathematics, neuroanatomy, philosophy, physics, psychiatry, psychology, statistics, art, and many others. The goal of Brainhack is to facilitate the cross pollination of ideas and knowledge across these various disciplines and communities, to accelerate the development of a richer understanding of the brain. In addition to sharing data and tools, attendees can contribute to this agenda in a variety of ways. Philosophical debates about the meanings of cognition, coordinated efforts to manually segment brain images from different species or curate neuroscience literature and helping others understand the subtleties of diagnosing a developmental disorder are all examples of extremely valuable contributions to the Brainhack.  


Attendance is open to all brain science disciplines including neuroimaging, EEG, genetics and others.

 Brainhacking is not just about number crunching, its about accelerating the progress of understanding the brain.


 Brainhack events more broadly involve projects focused on developing a better understanding of the brain. 
 
 





Engendering 



## Organizational foundations

- what's happening with brainhack: (general intro to format and project-based participation...)
  
### Hackathons based on collaboration, not competition

The hackathon format gained prominence in the technology sector by providing a meeting model that targets specific project goals during intense time-limited collaborations. The competitive aspect of the traditional hackathon, while catalyzing advances toward specific techology ends, was determined to run counter to the founding motive of Brainhack of encouraging open, cross-institutional collaboration. Thus, participants have the opportunity to propose projects at [www.brainhack.org](http://www.brainhack.org) prior to the event. 

### Unconference

The unconference format constitutes the second structural component of Brainhack and provides the opportunity for on-site scheduling of presentations, panels, and discussions. Content can range from project updates and current controversies / methodological challenges, to educational. 

## Project examples

Following are examples of projects that have previously been initiated at Brainhacks:

- [Mennes et al 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914002973) pooled data at brainhack to reach a sample size of N=14,781 in their imaging study of optimization of field of view for maximal brain coverage. 
- [Vanderwal et al In Press](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915006898) collaboration between a 3D artist and a child psychiatrist to reduce in-scanner motion in resting-state fMRI using a movie specifically tailored for that purpose. [video link](http://vimeo.com/67962604)
- [Das et al. 2012](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fninf.2011.00037/abstract) the development team of LORIS, an open-source database system for neuroimaging and phenotypic data, have repeatedly used brainhack as an opportunity to meet and collaborate on new features.

- [Daydreaming app](http://daydreaming-the-app.net) 
- [Multi-center mapping of structural network alterations in autism](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.22776/full)

## Future challenges
- series of events that culminate at the OHBM hackathon??
- variation of the format into a teaching-oriented event?

### Distributed events
- describe types of brainhack events

### Hosting a Brainhack
- encourage others to host brainhacks in their own areas

### Post-conference publications
- motivate post-conference publications and brainhack thematic series
