With myriad possibilities for the instantaneous sharing of scientific research available today, how can the contemporary conference format take unique advantage of the personal contact it provides? *Brainhack* has  provide a space for interaction across institutional boundaries...

How can the contemporary conference format contribute in innovative ways to the sharing of information, the generation of new ideas, and the catalyzing of curiosity? In the age of the Internet, where ideas can so easily be shared, what unique role does the conference space provide? Brainhack, in part, was an answer to the challenge of creating a space which disolved traditional academic hierarchies, structured programs, even predetermined content, to open opportunities for something new to emerge--- to sew seeds of collaboration.

# Introducing Brainhack

- What is brainhack: (explain brainhacks to the uninitiated - this has always been our biggest challenge)
	- legitimize brainhacks to community and potential partners
	- encourage participation (make everyone feel invited and as though they can make a real contribution, or at least get something out of it)
		- but im not a programmer how do can I contribute? 

With all the laudable efforts that go into conference programming, some of the most thrilling moments for attendees often occur in the unplanned moments of the coffee break. Chance encounters, informal musings, open discussion across academic hierarchies--- while impossible to programme, their probability of occurance can be enhanced through allowing for sufficient time and a conference culture that encourages open interaction.

## Organizational foundations

- what's happening with brainhack: (general intro to format and project-based participation...)
  
### Hackathons based on collaboration, not competition

The hackathon format gained prominence in the technology sector by providing a meeting model that targets specific project goals during intense time-limited collaborations. The competitive aspect of the traditional hackathon, while catalyzing advances toward specific techology ends, was determined to run counter to the founding motive of Brainhack of encouraging open, cross-institutional collaboration. Thus, participants have the opportunity to propose projects at [www.brainhack.org](http://www.brainhack.org) prior to the event. 

### Unconference

The unconference format constitutes the second structural component of Brainhack and provides the opportunity for on-site scheduling of presentations, panels, and discussions. Content can range from project updates and current controversies / methodological challenges, to educational. 

## Project examples

Following are examples of projects that have previously been initiated at Brainhacks:

    - [Mennes et al 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914002973) pooled data at brainhack to reach a sample size of N=14,781 in their imaging study of optimization of field of view for maximal brain coverage. 
    - [Vanderwal et al In Press](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915006898) collaboration between a 3D artist and a child psychiatrist to reduce in-scanner motion in resting-state fMRI using a movie specifically tailored for that purpose. 
    - [Das et al. 2012](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fninf.2011.00037/abstract) the development team of LORIS, an open-source database system for neuroimaging and phenotypic data, have repeatedly used brainhack as an opportunity to meet and collaborate on new features. 
    - Toro's braincatalogue.org (*I believe this was conceived at Brainhack, and then received a 100K grant, but I'll verify with Roberto.*)
 

## Future challenges
- Future of brainhack:
	- describe types of brainhack events
	- encourage others to host brainhacks in their own areas
	- series of events that culminate at the OHBM hackathon??
	- motivate post-conference publications and brainhack thematic series  
	- variation of the format into a teaching-oriented event?
