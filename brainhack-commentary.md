With myriad possibilities for the instantaneous sharing of scientific research available today, how can the contemporary conference format take unique advantage of the personal contact it provides? *Brainhack* has  provide a space for interaction across institutional boundaries...

How can the contemporary conference format contribute in innovative ways to the sharing of information, the generation of new ideas, and the catalyzing of curiosity? In the age of the Internet, where ideas can so easily be shared, what unique role does the conference space provide? Brainhack, in part, was an answer to the challenge of creating a space which disolved traditional academic hierarchies, structured programs, even predetermined content, to open opportunities for something new to emerge--- to sew seeds of collaboration.



# Introducing Brainhack

Now in their third year, international and regional Brainhack events bring together brain enthusiasts from a variety of backgrounds to build relationships, learn from one another, and work on projects related to the brain. Brainhacks are unconventional events that adapt concepts from hackathons and unconferences to brain research. Similar to hackathons, Brainhack events primarily involve unstructured time during which participants collaborate intensitvely to complete various projects. Rather than focusing on computer programming, projects at the Brainhack can be completed using a much broader array of methods. Time is also set aside for periodic "unconference" sessions, which involve presentations whose content is dynamicaly determined based on the interests of attendees. This combined model encourages active participation and interaction between attendees and maximizes the relevance of the content.

There is no ideal background, skillset or experience level for Brainhack attendees. Fully translating neuroscience data to knowledge requires expertise that spans the gamut from biology, computer science, engineering, informatics, mathematics, neuroanatomy, philosopy, physics, psychiatry, psychology, statistics, art, and many others. The  goal of the Brainhack is to facilitate the cross pollenation of ideas and knowledge across these various disciplines and communities, to accelerate the development of a richer understanding of the brain. In addition to sharing data and tools, attendees can contribute to this agenda in a variety of ways. Philosophical debates about the meanings of cognition, coordinated efforts to manually segment brain images from different species, curating neuroscience literature, or helping others understand the subtelties of diagnosing a developmental disorder are all examples of extremely valuable contributions to the Brainhack.  

## Organizational foundations

Brainhack events have spanned one to three days and include a variety of content to make them accessible and fruitful for a wide audience of attendees. The format of the events is not fixed, but varies based on what the local organizing committee deams most salient to attendees. In general, a few different types of content are available at Brainhack events:

- **Meet and great:** Brainhack events begin with a welcome to the hosting facility by the local organizing committee, along with a briefing about the event schedule, procedures, or other information that might be important for the attendees.
- **Ice breaker:** Interaction between attendees is the key to a successful Brainhack event.  The ice breaker is an activity to introduce attendees and their interestes on one another. One strategy that has been successful is for each attendee, in turn, give their name, their institution, and three words that describe their interests. We have toyed with the idea of a speed-dating paradigm in which attendees pair-up for a brief conversation, after 2 minutes attendees swap partners, and this continues until every pair of attendees has met. This strategy has yet to be implemented at any of the Brainhack events. 
- **Ignite talks:** Brainhack's equivalent of keynote sessions, Ignite talks are inspirational talks on the big picture of open brain science that are intended to invigorate the audience and set the agenda for the day. These are ideally short, usually 20 minutes with 10 minutes of questions, and are provided by a luminary in the field.
- **Hacking:** The core of Brainhack is "open hacking" sessions during which attendess collaborate together on projects of their choosing. Attendees who have specific project ideas or data that they would like to explore are encouraged to advertise their project at [www.brainhack.org](http://www.brainhack.org) prior to the event. On the opening of the Brianhack event, typically after the ice breaker, attendees pitch their ideas and afterwards mingle with others to organize a project team. Teams work together throughout the remainder of Brainhack and are given the opportunity to present their progress during the wrap-up session at the end of the event. 
- **Brainhacking 101:** In response to feedback from previous Brainhack events, an educational track has been added to teach basic software and data analysis skills to researchers who are weak in these areas. The educational track occurs in parallel, and is designed not to interfere, with the hacking track. The track begins with "Installfest" sessions during which attendees receive help installing needed software. Afterwards are several hands-on tutorials that cover topics like: using Github, Python programming, using Python  to load and visualize neuroimaging data, and performing meta-analyses of scientific literature.
- **Unconference:** Time is set aside for attendees to present on their research or other topics of interest. The agenda for these sessions are determined onsite an hour or two before they are to occur. Attendees who are willing to present add their name to a signup sheet and in the event that there are more interested presenters than time, the group is polled to determine which presentations are given time or to extend the amount of time alloted. Instead of unconference sessions, some sites have incorporate "Data Blitzes", which is a pre-organized session that provides interested attendees the opportunity to present on their research. Brainhack Miami has had a lot of success with this model and has secured funding to award monetary prizes to the best presentations.
- **Wrapup and feedback:** Brainahack events typically end with a wrap-up session during which project teams describe the progress that they made or give a demo of their results. Afterwards, the local organizers lead a discussion about what worked well with the event, and what should be changed in the future.

  
### Hackathons based on collaboration, not competition

The hackathon format gained prominence in the technology sector by providing a meeting model that targets specific project goals during intense time-limited collaborations. The competitive aspect of the traditional hackathon, while catalyzing advances toward specific techology ends, is contrary to the founding motive of Brainhack, which is to encourage open, cross-institutional and inter-disciplinary collaboration. Rather than subdividing attendees into competetive factions, each of whom are trying to solve the exact same prespecified problem, the "Brainhack way" is to encourage attendees to work together in collaborative teams to solve problems of their choosing. In this way we have not only attained solutions to many problems, rather than many solutions to a single problem, but we have pollenated new relationships that will hopefully be productive well into the future.

## Project examples

Following are examples of projects that have previously been initiated and/or completed at Brainhack evens:

- [@Mennes2014] [Mennes et al 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914002973) pooled data at brainhack to reach a sample size of N=14,781 in their imaging study of optimization of field of view for maximal brain coverage. 
- [Vanderwal et al In Press](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915006898) collaboration between a 3D artist and a child psychiatrist to reduce in-scanner motion in resting-state fMRI using a movie specifically tailored for that purpose. [video link](http://vimeo.com/67962604)

## Future challenges
- series of events that culminate at the OHBM hackathon??
- variation of the format into a teaching-oriented event?

### Distributed events
- describe types of brainhack events

### Hosting a Brainhack
- encourage others to host brainhacks in their own areas

### Post-conference publications
- motivate post-conference publications and brainhack thematic series
