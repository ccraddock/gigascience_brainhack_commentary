\section{Introducing Brainhack}

Now in their third year, international and regional Brainhack events bring together brain enthusiasts from a variety of backgrounds to build relationships, learn from one another, and collaborate on projects related to the neurosciences. Brainhacks are unconventional events that adapt concepts from both ``hackathons'' and ``unconferences'' to engage in topics related to brain research. Similar to hackathons, Brainhack events primarily involve unstructured time during which participants collaborate intensively to initiate, develop, and complete various projects. Rather than focusing on computer programming, projects at Brainhacks can be completed using a much broader array of methods. Time is also set aside for periodic unconference sessions, which involve presentations whose content is dynamically determined based on the interests of attendees. In consideration of the ever expanding interest in the tools of open science, Brainhack has developed an eductional component that runs in parallel to the hacking sessions in order to introduce the basic tools of open collaboration. This combined model encourages active participation and interaction between attendees, while also maximizing the topical relevance of the more formally presented content (see Figure~\ref{fig1}).

\end{figure}

There is no ideal background, skill set, or experience level required for Brainhack attendees. Fully translating neuroscience data to knowledge requires expertise that spans the gamut from biology, computer science, engineering, informatics, mathematics, neuroanatomy, philosophy, physics, psychiatry, psychology, statistics, art, and many others. The goal of a Brainhack event is to facilitate the cross pollination of ideas and knowledge across these various disciplines and communities and to accelerate the development of a richer understanding of the brain. In addition to sharing data and tools, attendees can contribute in a variety of ways. Philosophical debates about the meanings of cognition, coordinated efforts to manually segment brain images from different species, curating neuroscience literature, or helping others to understand the subtleties of diagnosing a developmental disorder are all examples of valuable contributions that have emerged at Brainhacks (for further examples, see Table~\ref{tab3}).

\section{Hackathons based on collaboration, not competition}

The hackathon format gained prominence in the technology sector by providing a meeting model that targets specific project goals during intense time-limited collaborations. The competitive aspect of the traditional hackathon, while catalyzing rapid advances toward specific technology ends, is contrary to the founding motive of Brainhack, which is to encourage open, cross-institutional and inter-disciplinary collaboration. Rather than subdividing attendees into competitive factions, Brainhack attendees are encouraged to work together in collaborative teams to solve problems of their choosing. In this way, rather than obtaining many solutions to a single problem, we aim to produce various solutions to many problems. Most importantly, we encourage the building of new relationships that continue to be productive beyond the end of the event.

\subsection{Brainhack projects}

Rather than focusing on a specific problem or toolset, which is common at more standard Hackathons, attendees are encouraged to generate their own projects ideas around which they can self-assemble into project teams. As a consequence, some projects may receive more limited interest, whereas another might attract the majority of attendees. In this way, the projects developed at Brainhacks are elected by participation, rather than being pre-specified by the event organizers. This model is more conducive to collaboration than the alternative model of organizing a Hackathon around a challenge or competition. While there are of many different alternative models between these two extremes, we are currently working on building thematic Brainhack events that bring researchers together to focus on more specific questions in neuroscience.

To date, projects that have been completed at Brainhack events have spanned from students interacting with more experienced researchers to learn about a new data modality or analysis method, inter-disciplinary collaborations to improve data collection for hyper-kinetic populations, the development or optimization of data analysis tools, to testing hypothesis about brain structure using openly shared data. See Table~\ref{tab3} for selected examples of projects that have previously been initiated at Brainhack events, and \href{http://www.brainhack.org}{www.brainhack.org} for a full list of projects.

\subsection{Event organization}

Brainhack events span one to four days and included a variety of content to make them accessible and fruitful for a wide range of attendees. The format of the events is not fixed, but varies based on the needs determined by the local organizing committee. At past events, the schedule has included various components aiming to quickly integrate the attendees and generate an environment condusive to productive collaboration. We have found the activity categories included in Table~\ref{tab4} to be valuable components of creating a productive environment. 

Considering the novel format of such events, the attendance fees are kept as low as possible to encourage attendence. This has been made possible in the past through generous financial support and meeting space from local hosting institutions and corporate sponsors. When possible, lunch and dinner have been provided to encourage continued interaction between attendees throughout the duration of the event. We have also aimed to reduce travel costs by co-locating events with other international workshops, such as the 2012 Resting Workshop in Magdeburg Germany, and annual meetings of the Organization of Human Brain Mapping (OHBM). OHBM has been particularly supportive of the Brainhack model and the annual OHBM Hackathon has evolved to include a two-day intensive hackathon, an additional educational day that is open to all OHBM attendees, and an open collaboration room that is available throughout the meeting.

\subsubsection{Distributed events}

The Brainhack began as international events that drew attendees from all over the world to work together in open collaboration. Initial efforts to transfer this model to the local level were less successful due to fears that local events would not be able to provide enough content to attract attendees. Brainhack Eastern Daylight Time (Brainhack EDT) was developed to address these concerns by organizing several simultaneous events and linking them together to share content. Events were limited to sites in time zones within one hour of eastern daylight time to simplify scheduling. This innovative distributed model drew 150 attendees across seven sites located in three different countries, and has since been followed by Brainhack Americas, which extended this model to the entirety of North, South and Central America (see Tables \ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2}).

\section{Conclusions}

Considering the relative novelty of the Brainhack event, there remains substantial space of innovative programming components and improvement in structure. With the general aim of building a productive working conference, ...

Further development of infrastructure for distributed Brainhack events to facilitate local hosting of events. 

Finally, the educational component encourages future participation and provides the tools ...
