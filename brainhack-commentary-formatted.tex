\section{Brainhack}\label{brainhack}

Now in their third year, international and regional Brainhack events bring together brain enthusiasts from a variety of backgrounds to build relationships, learn from one another, and collaborate on projects related to the brain. Brainhacks are unconventional events that adapt concepts from both ``hackathons'' and ``unconferences'' to engage in topics related to brain research. Similar to hackathons, Brainhack events primarily involve unstructured time during which participants collaborate intensively to initiate, develop, and complete various projects. Rather than focusing on computer programming, projects at Brainhacks can be completed using a much broader array of methods. Time is also set aside for periodic unconference sessions, which involve presentations whose content is dynamically determined based on the interests of attendees. This combined model encourages active participation and interaction between attendees, while also maximizing the topical relevance of the more formally presented content.

There is no ideal background, skill set, or experience level required for Brainhack attendees. Fully translating neuroscience data to knowledge requires expertise that spans the gamut from biology, computer science, engineering, informatics, mathematics, neuroanatomy, philosophy, physics, psychiatry, psychology, statistics, art, and many others. The goal of a Brainhack event is to facilitate the cross pollination of ideas and knowledge across these various disciplines and communities and to accelerate the development of a richer understanding of the brain. In addition to sharing data and tools, attendees can contribute in a variety of ways. Philosophical debates about the meanings of cognition, coordinated efforts to manually segment brain images from different species, curating neuroscience literature, or helping others to understand the subtleties of diagnosing a developmental disorder are all examples of valuable contributions that have emerged at Brainhack events.

\section{Hackathons based on collaboration, not competition}\label{hackathons-based-on-collaboration-not-competition}

The hackathon format gained prominence in the technology sector by providing a meeting model that targets specific project goals during intense time-limited collaborations. The competitive aspect of the traditional hackathon, while catalyzing rapid advances toward specific technology ends, is contrary to the founding motive of Brainhack, which is to encourage open, cross-institutional and inter-disciplinary collaboration. Rather than subdividing attendees into competitive factions, at Brainhacks attendees are encouraged to work together in collaborative teams to solve problems of their choosing. In this way,  rather than obtaining many solutions to a single problem, we aim to produce various solutions to many problems,  and most importantly we encourage the building of new relationships that will hopefully continue to be productive beyond the end of the Brainhack.

\subsection{Brainhack events}

The attendance fees of a Brainhack event are kept as low as possible, and have been successful in the past through generous financial support and meeting space from local hosting institutions and corporate sponsors. Lunch and dinner have been provided at several past events to facilitate continued interaction between attendees. 

We have aimed to reduce travel costs by co-locating events with other international workshops, such as the 2012 Resting Workshop in Magdeburg Germany, and annual meetings of the Organization of Human Brain Mapping (OHBM). OHBM has been particularly supportive of the Brainhack model and the annual OHBM Hackathon has evolved to include a two-day intensive hackathon, an educational day that is open to all OHBM attendees, and an open collaboration room that is available throughout the meeting.

The Brainhack began as international events that drew attendees from all over the world to work together in open collaboration. Initial efforts to transfer this model to the local level were less successdul due to fears that local events would not be able to provide enough content to attract attendees. Brainhack Eastern Daylight Time (Brainhack EDT) was developed to address these concerns, by organizing several simultaneous events and linking them together to share content. Events were limited to sites in time zones within one hour of eastern daylight time to simplify scheduling. This innovative distributed model was extremely successful and drew 150 attendees across seven sites in thee countries, and has since been followed by Brainhack Americas, which extended this model to the entirety of North, South and Central America (see Tables \ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2}).


\subsection{Content}

Previous Brainhack events have spanned one to four days and include a variety of content to make them accessible and fruitful for a wide audience of attendees (see Tables \ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2}). The format of the events is not fixed, but varies based on what the local organizing committee deems most salient to attendees. In general, several different types of content can constitute the schedule of Brainhack events:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Meet and great:} Brainhack events begin with a welcome to the hosting facility by the local organizing committee, along with a briefing about the event schedule, procedures, or other information that might be important for the attendees.
\item
  \textbf{Ice breaker:} Interaction between attendees is the key to a successful Brainhack event. The ice breaker is an activity to introduce attendees and their interests on one another. One strategy that has been successful is for each attendee, in turn, give their name, their institution, and three words that describe their interests. We have discussed a speed-dating paradigm in which attendees pair-up for a brief conversation, after 2 minutes attendees swap partners, and this continues until every pair of attendees has met. This strategy has yet to be implemented at any of the Brainhack events.
\item
  \textbf{Ignite talks:} Brainhack's equivalent of keynote sessions, Ignite talks are inspirational talks on the big picture of open brain science that are intended to invigorate the audience and set the agenda for the day. These are ideally short, usually 20 minutes with 10 minutes of questions, and are provided by a luminary in the field.
\item
  \textbf{Hacking:} The core of Brainhack is ``open hacking'' sessions during which attendees collaborate together on projects of their choosing. Attendees who have specific project ideas or data that they would like to explore are encouraged to advertise their project at \href{http://www.brainhack.org}{www.brainhack.org} prior to the event. On the opening of the Brainhack event, typically after the ice breaker, attendees pitch their ideas and afterwards mingle with others to organize a project team. Teams work together throughout the remainder of Brainhack and are given the opportunity to present their progress during the wrap-up session at the end of the event.
\item
  \textbf{Brainhacking 101:} In response to feedback from previous Brainhack events, an educational track has been added to teach basic software and data analysis skills to researchers who are weak in these areas. The educational track occurs in parallel, and is designed not to interfere, with the hacking track. The track begins with ``Installfest'' sessions during which attendees receive help installing needed software. Afterwards are several hands-on tutorials that cover topics like: using Github, Python programming, using Python to load and visualize neuroimaging data, and performing meta-analyses of scientific literature. The resources for educational sessions are made freely available online (e.g., see \href{https://github.com/ohbm/brain-hacking-101}{https://github.com/ohbm/brain-hacking-101}).
\item
  \textbf{Unconference:} Time is set aside for attendees to present on their research or other topics of interest. The agenda for these sessions are determined on-site an hour or two before they are to occur. Attendees who are willing to present add their name to a sign-up sheet and in the event that there are more interested presenters than time, the group is polled to determine which presentations are given time or to extend the amount of time allotted. Instead of unconference sessions, some sites have incorporated ``Data Blitzes'', which is a pre-organized session that provides interested attendees the opportunity to present their research. Brainhack Miami has had success with this model and has secured funding to award monetary prizes to the best presentations.
\item
  \textbf{Wrap-up and feedback:} Brainhack events typically end with a wrap-up session during which project teams describe the progress that they made or give a demo of their results. Afterwards, the local organizers lead a discussion about what worked well with the event, and what should be changed in the future.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Brainhack projects}\label{project-examples}

Rather than focusing on a specific problem or toolset, which is common at more standard Hackathons, attendees are encouraged to generate their own projects ideas, and then self-assemble into project teams to work on them. As a consequence, some projects may receive very little interest, whereas another might attract the majority of attendees. In this way, the projects worked at the Brainhack are those that are deemed most interesting to attendees, rather than being pre-specified by the event organizers. This model is more conducive to collaboration than the alternative model of organizing a Hackathon around a challenge or competition. There are of many different alternative models between these two extremes, and we are currently working on building thematic Brainhack events that are focused on bringing researchers together to address specific questions in neuroscience, such as the mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorders.  

To date, projects that have been completed at Brainhack events have spanned the gamut from students interacting with more experienced researchers to learn about a new data modality or analysis method, inter-disciplinary collaborations to improve data collection for hyper-kinetic populations, the development or optimization of data analysis tools, to testing hypothesis about brain structure using openly shared data. Many of these have led to publication in peer-reviewed journals. At the early events in Leipzig and Paris, attendees have tried to complete an elusive 24 hour experiment, in which experiment design, data collection, and statistical analysis is all performed within 24 hours. Although the ultimate goal has been to collect physiological recordings of brain activity (i.e. fMRI), these experiments have typically focused on behavioral assessments due to lack of time. A poster generated by first 24-hour experiment, which was conducted in Leipzig Germany, won an award for being a crowd favorite at the 2012 Resting State Workshop in Magdeburg, Germany. Following are more examples of projects that have previously been initiated and/or completed at Brainhack evens:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
  A child pschyiatrist and a 3D video artist built a collaboration at the 2012 Brainhack and UnConference to develop a movie to be shown to participants during resting-state fMRI scans to reduce head motion in hyperkinetic populations \href{http://vimeo.com/67962604}{(video link)}\cite{vanderwal2015}.
\item 
  The \href{http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.github.io/abide}{ABIDE Preprocessing Initiative} is an ongoing project started at the 2012 Brainhack and UnConference to share preprocessed versions of the \href{http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide}{Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)} dataset. This project is sharing functional data that have been processed using the \href{http://lfcd.psych.ac.cn/ccs.html}{Connectome Computation System (CCS)}, the \href{http://fcp-indi.github.io}{Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC)}, the \href{http://rfmri.org/DPARSF}{Data Preprocessing Assistant for Resting State fMRI (DPARSF)}, and the \href{https://www.nitrc.org/projects/niak/}{Neuro Imaging Analysis Kit (NIAK)}, as well as, cortical thickness measures extracted from structural data using \href{http://freesurfer.net/}{FreeSurfer}, \href{http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/CIVET}{CIVET}, and \href{http://picsl.upenn.edu/software/ants/}{Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS)}.
\item
  A collaboration started at the 2012 Brainhack and UnConference performed an analysis to identify differences in cortical thickness and structural covariance between individuals who suffer from autism spectrum disorder and healthy controls\cite{Valk2015}.
\item 
  A project team at Brainhack 2013 amassed a dataset of 14,781 structural MRI scans to estimate the distribution of brain sizes across individuals for optimizing scan acquisition parameters\cite{Mennes2014}.
\item 
  The development team of LORIS, an open-source database system for neuroimaging and phenotypic data, have repeatedly used brainhack as an opportunity to meet and collaborate on new features\cite{Das2012}.
\item
  An early version of the \href{http://daydreaming-the-app.net}{Daydreaming app}, an Android application for real-time assessment of users mind-wandering was developed at Brainhack 2013.
